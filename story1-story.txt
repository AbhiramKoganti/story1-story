While ABhiram is focusing on his pokemon fight, a group of students from
 Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry entered the library. They all
look young, motivated and clever. Some of them are wearing Slytherin capes. 
Some of them are apparently from Gryffindor. One dumb-looking red headed
child, looking like a younger Hermione and with some resemblences of Ron is 
eating a jumbo chocolate frog. While ABhiram's pikachu seems defeated,
 his chocolate frog jumped out of his hand and got into ABhiram's coffee mug.
