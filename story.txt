My name is ABhiram and I am in college library. I am chilling with my x team

	, thought Abhiram. but what he didn't realize was that he was inside a
 simulation. Suddenly he got a call from his phone and a mysterious figure introduced
himself as "Shmorpheus". This was the real deal, Abhiram was directed to sneak away from
the library so that Shmorpheus could pull him out of the simulation. But just as he was
exiting the library an agent challenged him to a fight

With a valiant cry of "I choose you, Pikachu!", he tossed his Poke Ball and out came a deadbeat
Pikachu with the voice of Ryan Reynolds. Quoting lines from "Deadpool", this Pikachu charged at the 
agent with all his might, and managed to put a wrinkle in his suitcoat. The agent stared blankly,
saying "You should know the electric rat needs a Thunderstone to evolve into Raichu before it's any 
good in battle."
